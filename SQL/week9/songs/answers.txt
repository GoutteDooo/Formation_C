If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
---> I think we need to have another short database where we store the range of each auras, and then, with the result we found by calculating, we just join this result to the corresponding aura.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
