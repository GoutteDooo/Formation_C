a

passes

well
welcome

there's
a
nice
way
to
say
that
with
that
he
starts
playing
jingle
bells
int
restaurant
later
the
restaurant's
demographic
has
changed
it's
now
younger

looks
beyond
bored
he
finishes
we
wish
you
a
merry
christmas
zero
applause
he
begins
a
new
chart
deck
the
halls
but
something
seems
to
come
over
him
now
he's
restless
slowly
his
playing
drifts
off
his
fingers
charting
their
own
path
and
then
we
hear
a
melody
the
one
mia
heard
outside
the
one
we'll
refer
to
from
now
on
as
mia
and
sebastian's
song
the
door
opens
and
mia
steps
in
she
sees
sebastian
at
the
piano
is
instantly
struck
by
his
playing
mia
and
sebastian's
theme
gradually
all
sounds
but
the
music
drop
out
we
drift
away
from
reality
even
the
walls
seem
to
go
slightly
darker
as
though
sebastian
and
mia
were
all
alone
he
concludes
his
piece
with
a
jumble
of
chords
his
playing
almost
free
jazz
now
as
we
pull
back
to
real
life
and
see
the
boss
looking
on
in
scorn
revision
sebastian
finishes
silence
mia
looks
like
the
wind
has
been
knocked
out
of
her
sebastian
looks
up
for
a
second
and
sees
her
they
look
at
one
another
just
a
moment
then
the
boss
taps
sebastian
on
the
shoulder
we
stay
on
mia
as
she
watches
sebastian
rise
with
the
boss
we
just
see
the
boss
talking
to
sebastian
can't
hear
what
is
said
then
we
get
closer
and
realize
boss
every
goddamned
night
sebastian
is
silent
then
doesn't
want
to
have
to
beg
but
sebastian
i'll
stick
to
the
set

i
promise
boss
too
late
you're
done
sebastian
you're
not
gonna
find
a
better
player
you
know
that
boss
leans
in
and
do
you
think
anyone
here
gives
a
shit
with
that
the
boss
walks
off
we
linger
on
sebastian
anger
giving
way
to
hurt
he
starts
hurrying
toward
the
door
back
to
mia
who
didn't
hear
what
was
said
she
watches
sebastian
takes
a
breath
so

an
added
measure
of
disdain
he
heads

probably
gives
you
cancer
but
you
find
your
car
more
quickly
mia
uh
huh
sebastian
you
don't
live
as
long
but
you
get
things
done
faster
so
it
all
evens
out
mia
oh
my
god
just
then
they
reach
a
clearing
and
the
city
skyline
appears
below
a
ribbon
of
lights
stretching
as
far
as
you
can
see
it's
the
most
romantic
sight
imaginable
they
look
at

they
walk

to
look
at
mia
agreed
i've
seen
better
and
on
that
they
sing
a
lovely
night
mia
and
sebastian
try
to
downplay
the
romanticism
of
this
setting
this
moment
being
lost
here
at
night
alone
together
atop
a
hill
the
city
glittering
before
them
it's
no
big
deal
nothing
they
haven't
seen
or
felt
before
because
after
all
there's
no
chance
for
romance
between
them
of
course
the
music
swelling
and
building
suggests
otherwise
mia
tires
of
her
heels
finds
a
bench
and
fishes
for
flats
in
her
handbag
sebastian
sits
beside
her
as
she
slips
the
flats
on
they
look
at
each
other
suspicious
revision
he
moves
his
foot
she
moves
hers
they
look
at
each
other
again
still
suspicious
he
moves
again
she
moves
again
they
seem
to
be
moving
in
sync
without
their
even
wanting
to
and
bit
by
bit
before
our
eyes
they've
almost
slipped
into
dance
sebastian
rises
mia
rises
as
well
the
two
look
at
each
other
run
back
to
the
bench
hop
atop
it
the
lights
stretch
out
like
a
magic
carpet
they
share
a
moment
share
a
look
jump
off
and
start
really
dancing
now
mia
does
a
move
sebastian
responds
sebastian
does
a
move
mia
shakes
her
head
nope
they
make
the
road
their
own
growing
more
and
more
energized
as
surprised
as
we
are
to
find
that
they
can
really
dance
together
just
as
this
starts
to
look
like
a
blossoming
romance
real
joy
peeking
through
our
two
heroes
getting
closer
and
closer
and
closer
looking
at
each
other
almost
giddily
a
sound
cuts
through
it's
a
cell
phone
ring
mia
and
sebastian
turn
to
her
handbag
back
by
the
bench
snapped
out
of
it
mia

was
in
this
traveling
theater
company
and
there
was
this
little
library
across
the
street
from
my
house
when
i
was
growing
up
this
was
boulder
city
nevada
every
house
looked
exactly
the
same
i
was
ten
and
already
i
needed
to
get
out
and
one
day
my
aunt
flew
into
town
and
she
showed
me
the
library's
old
movie
section
we
spent
a
whole
day
watching
one
after
the
other
bringing
up
baby
notorious
casablanca
a
beat
then
i
never
knew
the
world
was
so
big
director
o
s
cut
mia
and
sebastian
resume
walking
now
at
full
volume
mia
i
started
putting
on
plays
in
my
garage
i'd
write
the
scripts
and
print
up
programs
and
she'd
give
me
props
to
use
from
wherever
she'd
just
been
new
york
london
paris
and
then
she'd
jet
off
again
and
i
wouldn't
hear
from
her
for
another
year
sebastian
who
would
you
invite
to
watch
your
parents
mia
god
no
i
didn't
invite
anyone
that
would
have
been
terrifying
cut
to
the
entrance
to
a
giant
soundstage
mia
cont'd
honestly
i
wish
i
loved
something
else
i've
tried
so
hard
to
want
other
things
she
and
sebastian
stop
peer
inside
the
stage
mia
cont'd
i
left
school
after
two
years
to
come
here
my
fourth
manager
just
dropped
me
and
my
last
audition
was
for
a
teen
soap
pitched
as
dangerous
minds
meets
the
o
c
a
beat
then
deadpan
should've
been
a
lawyer
revision
they
resume
walking
cut
to
a
row
of
closed
soundstages
sandy
tan
against
the
bright
blue
sky
sebastian
cause
the
world
needs
more
lawyers
mia
well
it
doesn't
need
more
actresses
sebastian
you're
not
just
an
actress
mia
what
do
you
mean
just
an
actress
sebastian
you
said
it
yourself
you're
a
child
prodigy
playwright
mia
that
is
not
what
i
said
sebastian
you're
too
modest
to
say
it
but
it's
true
so
you
could
write
your
own
roles
write
something
that's
as
interesting
as
you
are
mia
last
thing
i
wrote
was
a
stand
up
routine
for
an
open
mic
night
it
was
horrible
sebastian
all
i'm
saying
is
louis
armstrong
could
have
played
the
marching
band
charts
he
was
given
what
did
he
do
instead
he
made
history
mia
ok
i'll
stop
auditioning
and
make
history
instead
sebastian
laughs
mia
cont'd
anyway
i'm
getting
a
feeling
there's
something
i
should
tell
you
sebastian
yeah
revision
mia
i
hate
jazz
sebastian
stops
turns
to
her
sebastian
what
does
that
mean
i
hate
jazz
mia
it
means
when
i
listen
to
it
i
don't
like
it
sebastian
but
it's
such
a
blanket
statement
it's
like
saying
i
hate
animals
mia
i
do
hate
some
animals
sebastian
do
you
need
to
be
anywhere
right
now
mia
looks
at
him
we
hear
drums
a
swinging
ride
pattern
and
we're
in
int
lighthouse
cafe
day
an
old
school
jazz
club
it's
almost
empty
only
aged
jazz
cats
here
except
for
mia
and
sebastian
watching
a
quartet
sebastian
cont'd
most
people
say
they
hate
jazz
because
they
don't
have
context
they
don't
get
where
it
came
from
all
these
people
packed
into
flophouses
in
new
orleans
speaking
five
different
languages
and
jazz
was
how
they
talked
to
each
other
mia
i
thought
it
was
just
kenny
g
sebastian
what
mia
looks
at
him
already
knows
just
how
to
get
to
him
mia
i
associate
it
with
facials
it's
relaxing
sebastian
it's
not
relaxing
sid
bechet
got
into
a
gunfight
cause
somebody
told
him
he
played
a
wrong
note
revision
mia
laying
it
on
thick
right
but
it's
good
to
talk
over
where
i
grew
up
there's
this
jazz
station
they'd
play
at
cocktail
parties
whenever
they
served
the
salami
and
cheese
sebastian
mia
these
are
things
you
can't
unsay
she
bursts
into
laughter
sebastian
points
to
the
band
sebastian
cont'd
it's
not
cocktail
music
it's
a
high
wire
act
these
guys
are
performing
and
composing
and
rearranging
all
at
once
a
beat
mia
looks
at
the
band
we
drift
over
the
instruments
sebastian
cont'd
that's
why
you
need
to
be
in
the
space
and
see
what's
at
stake
this
whole
thing
it's
dying
in
twenty
minutes
they'll
head
off
to
cut
commercial
sessions
or
do
pit
at
the
pantages
cause
they
have
to
but
when
i
have
my
own
place
my
club
they'll
play
whatever
they
want
mia
looks
at
sebastian
her
laughter
has
subsided
she
can
see
something
in
him
now
the
same
passion
he's
speaking
of
mia
your
club
sebastian
it's
gonna
be
the
old
van
beek
i'm
getting
the
lease
back
it'll
be
perfect
he
watches
the
band
lost
in
the
sound
then
sincere
sebastian
cont'd
the
world
tells
everyone
to
move
on
says
the
music's
had
its
moment
but
i
love
it
too
much
i'm
not
moving
on
the
band
finishes
the
ride
cymbal
sizzles
in
the
air
sebastian
cont'd
so
he
looks
at
mia
she's
visibly
moved
just
then
we

a
newfound
giddiness
and
on
that

lighthouse
cafe
evening
mia
and
sebastian
exit
wave
good
bye
we
follow
sebastian
he
rounds
the
corner
nears
the
hermosa
beach
pier
and
begins
to
sing
city
of
stars
lifted
by
a
strange
new
feeling
a
feeling
he
wasn't
expecting
the
feeling
that
perhaps
just
perhaps
he's
falling
in
love
he
gazes
out
at
the
sea
the
purple
sky
dances
with
an
old
couple
then
continues
on
his
way
as
though
caught
in
a
dream
there's
an
uncertainty
in
his
singing
he's
not
sure
if
this
dream
will
sustain
but
for
now
it's
a
beautiful
feeling
the
music
simmers
down
and
we
fade
out

reviewing
her

looks
around
her
the

is
filled
with
actresses
silently
mouthing
their
lines
it's
a
bizarre
sight
a
dozen
women
moving
their
mouths
with
no

coming
out
at
all
what's
more
they're
all
in
variations
of
the

type
of

stare
at

mia
stays
quiet
in
her
own
thoughts
the
voices
around
her
fading
away
and
then
she
hears
it
coming
from
the
restaurant
speakers
peeking
out
subtly
at
first
the
melody
we
now
know
so
well
her
and
sebastian's
song
she
freezes
the
radio
music
seems
to
have
morphed
into
the
melody
and
the
tune
stirs
something
deep
within
her
a
few
seconds
pass
and
then
she
can't
deny
it
any
longer
it's
clear
as
day
to

she
rises

then
so
tenderly
so
nervously

a
dance
that

all
the
promise
in
their

about

trade
looks

then
they

begin
to
float
rising
from

nothing
stopping
them
soaring
past
the
views
of
comets
and
moons
and
nebulae
eyes
wide
their
emotions
seized
as
they
hold
each
other
tight
and
so
unspools
a
gravity
free
dance
mia
and
sebastian
spin
and
twirl
through
the
planetarium
as
though
they
themselves
were
in
outer
space
flying
through
the
cosmos
the
music
carries
them
higher
and
higher
and
their
spirits
likewise
soar
joyous
exuberant
until
finally
the
music
softens
mia
and
sebastian
drift
back
to
the
floor
like
feathers
they
land
on
a
pair
of
seats
there
once
again
seated
like
audience
members
at
a
movie
they
turn
and
look
into
each
other's
eyes
the
music
picks
back
up

the
big
finish

the
lovers
lean
in

in
true

hollywood

musical

lock
lips
it's
their
first
kiss
and
it's
a
kiss
to
remember
full
of
all
the
hope
and
yearning
and
terror
and
wonder
of
love's
first
blush
a
swoon
worthy
kiss

this

keith
plays
a

tom
echoes
it
on

then
malcolm
on

doesn't
feel

bad
the

build
on
the

sebastian
keeps
up
with

let
go

if

jazz
wouldn't
exist
if

tired

they
were
listening
to

then
i
mean
do
you
really
think
a

ninety

is
the
future

the
form
traditionalists
whined
when
kenny
clarke

we

the

you're

in
matching

ready

away
from

tries
to
hold
her

deep
in

tugs
against

of

to
no

she's
pushed
to
the
back
of
the

away
from

lights
and
into
shadow
the
final
chorus
begins
floor
shaking
fist
pounding
we
linger
on

watching

the

feverishly
tear
into

the

the

then
continues
in

track
audition
yes
this
audition
is
different
than
the
rest
and
the
switch
to
song
signals
just
that
mia's
nerves
fade
away
all
the
accents
and
fakery
of
earlier
auditions
a
distant
memory
this
is
mia
undisguised
pure
and
stark
and
beautiful
she
uses
the
story
of
her
aunt
jumping
into
the
river
to
paint
a
portrait
of
all
the
dreamers
in
the
world
all
the
people
who
are
told
they're
nuts
for
pursuing
their
passion
all
the
so
called
fools
who
take
the
plunge
she
sings
about
them
and
for
them
this
is
why
mia
does
what
she
does
why
she
simply
has
no
choice
the
song
ends
and
we
linger
on

it
recalls
the
visualization
of
his
dream
back
at
the
restaurant
that
night
in
winter
years
ago
gradually
as
sebastian
plays
his
surroundings
seem
to
grow
darker
slowly
subtly
at

with
just
shifts
in
lighting
then
a
shift

the
interior

changes

soon
we

this
in

is
an

a

the

the
gabled

the

the

everyone

the

the

up

to
beckon
her
to
audition
we
see
the
audition
silhouetted
against
a
wall
we
don't
hear
mia
sing
but
the
music
takes
on
the
melody
of
her
song
carrying
us
to
paris
sebastian
travels
there
with
mia
we
chart
the
journey
through
an
old
globe
the
same
one
we
saw
mia
use
for
her
play
a
miniature
plane
and
dissolves
the
old
hollywood
movie
way
finally
we
find
ourselves
looking
at
a
painted
backdrop
of
paris
the
same
one
mia
used
for
her
play
the
sacr
coeur
and
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
the
eiffel
tower
etched
in
bright
colors
the
ornate
lampposts
and
the
cobblestones
stretching
before
us
and
then
a

we
see

at

a

through

frozen
around

they
stop

look
at

as
the

lights
behind

start
to
glitter
like
all
the
stars
of
the
galaxy
they
dance
revision
this
is
the
last

we'll
ever
see
them
dance
and
they
seem
to
recognize
that
so
graceful
and
poised
are
their
movements

is
a
romance
more
perfect
than
a

mia

sit
down
to

the

glows
with
the
warmth
of

these
are

fluttering
by
grabbed
at
random
and
yet
all
concocted
dreamed
up
out

score
continuing
to
sway
and
taking
us
right
up
to
sebastian
and
mia
husband
and
wife
father
and
mother
hiring
a
babysitter
because
they've
decided
to
go
out
for
a
night
at
the
movies
we're
back
to
now
the
look
here
is
unaffected
just
everyday
the
music
quiets
slightly
everything
goes
more
natural
as
this
happily
married
couple
hit
the
road
then
find
themselves
blocked
by

take
a

down

then
hear
music
a
jazz
combo
playing
somewhere
and
step
into
a
place
that
looks
just
like
sebastian's
club
they
sit
down
to
listen
and
then
and
this
is
how
our
imagined
montage
musical
number
ends
the
combo's
pianist
who
of

is
not

launches
into
mia
and
sebastian's
melody
and
mia
and

look
at

goes
full
circle
back
to
where
it
started
as

softly

looks
at

their

lock
a

of
a
tear
in
both
and
ever
so
subtly
for
just
a
fleeting
second
mia
smiles
it's
the
kind
of
smile
you
could
miss
if
you
blinked
but
it's
enough
to
signal
to
sebastian
that
she
recognized
the
melody
he
played
and
that
she
still
remembers
it
and
still
thinks
of
it
to
